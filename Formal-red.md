# Formal Red Website Hero Section Plan

## Goal
Enhance the hero section to reflect the in-store experience, attract a younger male demographic, and create a dynamic, engaging first impression.

## Feasibility & Stack

| Option | Feasible Now? | Stack |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Depth-based parallax / mouse movement | ✅ | Figma prototype, GSAP, Three.js, WebGL |
| 3D-style video from 2D assets | ✅ | Sora (video), Runway, Kaiber |

## Problem
- The current hero section is too bland.  
- Client has recently pivoted to target younger male customers.  
- Formal Red is not just a suit store; it offers a full showroom experience:
  - One-to-one consultations  
  - Lavish décor  
  - Exceptional customer service  
- Client wishes to map this premium experience online.  
- Constraints: must remain within Shopify ecosystem.

## Solution
- Research existing website styles and competitor approaches to identify what "pops."  
- Introduce dynamic visual flare to the website while maintaining overall flow.  
- Develop Shopify-friendly dynamic styles for the hero section.  
- Utilize existing assets and propose design alternatives.  
- Implement:
  - Depth-based parallax / mouse movement  
  - 3D-style video from 2D assets  
- Focus solely on the **hero section** as the target for enhancements.  

## Tasks
1. Audit current hero section and identify weak points.  
2. Collect and review existing assets (images, videos, 3D models).  
3. Research competitor sites and inspiration for dynamic hero sections.  
4. Prototype depth-based parallax and 3D-style video approaches.  
5. Present design alternatives with pros/cons for Shopify implementation.  
6. Implement chosen solution within Shopify constraints.  
7. Test responsiveness, performance, and UX across devices.  
8. Final review and client approval.
